# Challenge Summary
How to do summation for matrix array and calculate the Fibonacci Sequence function

## Challenge Description
-Ask the candidate to write a function to add up the sum of each row in a matrix of arbitrary size, and return an array with the appropriate values.

-Ask the candidate to write a function to accepts an integer, and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.


## Approach & Efficiency
- using for loop for Fibonacci Sequence , and nested for-loop for Matrix

## Solution
