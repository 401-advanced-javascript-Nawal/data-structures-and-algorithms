# Trees
- A binary tree is a special type of tree in which every node or vertex has either no child node or one child node or two child nodes. A binary tree is an important class of a tree data structure in which a node can have at most two children.

## Challenge
- Write an instance method called find-maximum-value. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric

## Approach & Efficiency
- find-maximum-value() :  return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric. 

- Big O => O(1-n)
