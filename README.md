# Challenge Summary
- No background 

## Challenge Description
- Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string

## Approach & Efficiency
- Using for loop and string methods . 
- Big O ==> time = space = O(n)

- Big O explaination : 
* Tiem : since we will iterate over all the string after we split it by word and generate a new array so, it will takes a "n" time to cover all strings word to check if it's a repeated or not . 

* Space : we will save the words in array so, it will takes an array with size "n" based on the words numbers inside the string after splitted it .
