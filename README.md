# Challenge Summary
- No background about this validation 

## Challenge Description
- Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced.

## Approach & Efficiency
- I used forEach approach iterate over each string then check if the brackets exists and add one to counter then return true if the counter even unless is odd and return false . 
- Big O is O(n) when splitted the string and convert it to array . 
- It takes one Hour to solve it .
