# Trees
- A binary tree is a special type of tree in which every node or vertex has either no child node or one child node or two child nodes. A binary tree is an important class of a tree data structure in which a node can have at most two children.

## Challenge
1. Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
2. Create a BinaryTree class (Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately)
3. Create a BinarySearchTree class :
- Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once

## Approach & Efficiency
- preOrder() : Data => Left => Right => O(n)
- InOrder() : Left => Data => Right => O(n)
- PostOrder() : Left => Right => Data => O(n)
