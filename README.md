# Challenge Summary
- How to use the Queue data structure and it's methods ( enqueue & dequeue ).

## Challenge Description
- Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach
- enqueue(animal) : adds animal to the shelter. animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
- dequeue(pref): returns either a dog or a cat. If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency
- I used array approach and created 2 method to add at the last and remove from the first ( push and shift )
- takes two hours almost.
- Big O for enqueue is O(1)
- Big O for dequeue is O(1)

## Solution
