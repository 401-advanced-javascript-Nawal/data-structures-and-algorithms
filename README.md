# Singly Linked List
- Short brief how it's work and linked to each other as a object chain 

## Challenge
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge.

## Approach & Efficiency
- used class and constructor format , while loop 

## API
- insert : Create new Node and add it at first
- includes : find certain node 
- to string : convert all list items to string 
- insertBefore : Insert Node before another Node
- insertAfter : Insert node after given value 
- Append : add new node to the end of the list
- kthFromEnd : return the node's value in k position
- mergeLists : takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one list

# Big O efficiency
- mergeLists : since I will iterate over both linked list then merge it so , the big O notation will be for first LL is O(n) , and the second one O(n) so, the Big O for both it will be n square .
